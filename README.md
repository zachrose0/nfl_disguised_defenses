# NFL Disguised Defense Model

Using data from the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl, this project builds a model that predicts whether or not an NFL defense is disguising its look presnap.

A "disguised coverage" is defined as:
- 2 or more players initially lined up as a rusher dropping into coverage or
- 2 or more players not initally lined up as a rusher blitzing the quarterback

## Goal
Design a model that NFL offenses could use to alert their quarterback if the opposing defese is in a disguised coverage.
