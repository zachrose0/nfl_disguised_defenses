Using data from the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl, I created a model which predicts if an NFL defense is using a disguised coverage for a given play.
A disguised coverage is one in which 2 or more players initally lined up as a rusher do not initially rush the passer or when 2 or more players not initially lined up to rush the passer end up dropping into coverage.
